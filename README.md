# Patient Readmission Analysis – Hospital Case Study

# Introduction
This project explores patient readmission patterns at a hospital using a real-world dataset. The analysis aims to uncover key factors influencing readmissions and provide actionable recommendations to improve hospital performance and patient care.

# Problem Statement
Hospital readmissions can indicate gaps in patient care, inefficiencies, or underlying health risks. Understanding the drivers behind readmissions is critical for improving outcomes, optimising resources, and reducing costs.

# Aim & Objectives
Aim:To analyze patient data and identify trends, patterns, and risk factors associated with hospital readmissions.

Objectives:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and admission details.
- Identify correlations and trends related to readmission rates.
- Segment patients by age, gender, admission type, and clinical risk factors.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for hospital management.

# Tools Used
- Databricks: Data cleaning, processing and analysis.
- Excel: Pivot tables and charts for visualisation.
- GitHub: Project documentation and version control.

# Summary of Results
- Patient IDs: All admissions are unique; no duplication.
- Demographics: Patients span all adult age groups and both genders, with a slight majority in the 30–80 age range.
- Admission Types: Emergency admissions are more frequent than elective.
- Clinical Measures: Blood sugar levels are consistently higher than blood pressure across all age and gender groups.
- Readmission Patterns: No single variable (age, length of stay, diagnoses, blood pressure, blood sugar, previous admissions) strongly predicts readmission. Readmissions are distributed across all patient segments.

# Key Insights
- Patients with frequent admissions and high blood sugar are at higher risk and should be prioritised for follow-up.
- Most patients have normal stays and normal sugar, but chronic disease management remains essential.
- Blood sugar levels are stable across age and gender, while blood pressure varies more with age.
- Emergency admissions may benefit from enhanced triage and post-discharge support.

# Recommendations
- Flag and monitor high-risk patients (frequent admissions, high blood sugar).
- Enhance chronic disease management and discharge planning.
- Use automated alerts for combinations of risk factors.
- Regularly review patient data to refine care strategies.
